Hybrid Open–Closed License Agreement (Open
Collaboration and Reserved Rights Model)
Version 1.0 — “Dual Rights Hybrid License”
1. Purpose
This Agreement establishes a hybrid framework combining open-source collaboration principles with
proprietary protections. It allows sharing of ideas and works openly for innovation, while ensuring that
ownership, attribution, and reserved rights are maintained for creators and designated third parties.
2. Definitions
“Open Source Contributor” means any person who contributes ideas, code, or content under the open
license. “Creator/Owner” means the original author of the work. “Third Party Rights Holder” means a
company or entity granted exclusive or partial rights. “Work” means all intellectual property covered
under this license.
3. Open License Terms (Collaborative Rights)
Under the Open Collaboration License (OCL), the Work may be copied, modified, and distributed for
research, education, or personal projects, provided proper credit is given. Derivatives may be shared if
attribution to the original creator is maintained and the work is not misused.
4. Closed License Option (Exclusive or Reserved Rights)
The Creator/Owner may issue a Closed License Extension (CLE) to a Third Party granting commercial
or proprietary rights. The Third Party may monetize or restrict their implementation, while open
contributors retain authorship and open collaboration rights to their contributions.
5. Dual Protection Clause
Both parties acknowledge that open-source and closed-source layers coexist. Open ideas remain free;
closed applications are protected. Both frameworks coexist without invalidating the other.
6. Intellectual Property and Moral Rights
Creators retain full intellectual property and moral rights. Contributors own their submissions under
open terms. The Third Party Rights Holder owns the specific closed version licensed to them. These
rights coexist as layers of ownership.
7. Attribution Requirement
All versions must include creator name(s), license version and date, link to the source repository, and a
statement indicating open or closed version status.
8. Warranty and Liability Disclaimer
The Work is provided “as is,” without warranty. Creators and contributors are not liable for damages or
misuse under any circumstance.
9. Termination
Violations, including misuse or failure to credit, revoke usage rights until corrected or relicensed.
10. Governing Law
This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the stated jurisdiction unless amended by mutual
agreement.
11. Acknowledgment
By using or distributing the Work, all parties agree to this hybrid framework of Open Collaboration and
Reserved Rights.
