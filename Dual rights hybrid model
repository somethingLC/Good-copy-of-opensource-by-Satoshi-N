■ Hybrid Open–Closed License Agreement
“Dual Rights Hybrid Model” — v1.0
■ Overview
The Hybrid Open–Closed License bridges open collaboration and proprietary control. It enables
innovation, transparency, and shared development under open-source principles — while preserving
the creator’s intellectual property and allowing for exclusive commercial licensing to a third party.
■ Structure
License Layer Purpose Rights Retained
Open Collaboration License (OCL) Enables public sharing, improvement, and distribution. Creator and contributors keep authorship rightClosed License Extension (CLE)Grants proprietary or commercial rights to a designated third party. Third party holds commercial rights; creator reDual Protection Clause Both coexist legally. The open layer stays open; the closed layer stays protected. Mutual respect of boundaries.
■ Core Principles
1. Transparency & Trust — Collaboration remains open and credited. 2. Ownership & Control —
Creators maintain moral and IP rights. 3. Flexibility — Third parties may adopt closed rights for
commercialization. 4. Compatibility — Works with MIT, CC-BY, or dual licensing systems. 5. Integrity —
Violations revoke rights until remedied.
■ Key Clauses (Simplified)
- Attribution Required: All versions must credit original creators. - No Warranty: The Work is provided
“as is.” - Non-Interference: Closed use may not restrict open collaboration. - Coexistence: Both
licensing paths remain valid and enforceable.
